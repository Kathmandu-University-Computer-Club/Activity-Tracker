Description: Inside this folder we will document all of our meeting summaries which we call it as minute.
We've lots of things to discuss with the team about how will we organize our github projects and repositories.
But for now I've created thsi file to test new commit and also test if it fires an email service to kucc@googlegroups.com.
It actually didn't work. Adding my personal email to verify hope it works
